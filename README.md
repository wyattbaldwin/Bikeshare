# NY Citibike Analysis
This project is an analysis of bike-sharing data in NY using Tableau and Pandas. The goal is to show that the bike-sharing program is a solid business proposal.

## Story
The bike-sharing industry has seen a rapid growth in recent years, with more and more cities implementing programs to provide residents and visitors with an eco-friendly and convenient mode of transportation. In this project, we take a closer look at the bike-sharing program in New York City, using data analysis and visualization to understand the usage patterns and demographics of the program.

The data used in this project was collected from August 2019, and includes information such as trip duration, starting and ending locations, and user demographics. We used Pandas to clean and format the data, and Tableau to create various visualizations that showcase different aspects of the bike trips.

One of the key findings from our analysis is that the majority of riders are male. Additionally, we found that most trips occur during the morning and late afternoon, and that the majority of riders use subscriptions. These insights can help the bike-sharing program better understand the needs and preferences of their customers, and make improvements to the program accordingly.

Another interesting finding is that the weekday per hour usage is similar for males and females, but males stand out due to their higher number of riders. It is also observed that the majority of the trips are short with an average duration of about 5-6 minutes.

While this project provides a comprehensive look at the bike-sharing program in New York City, there is still room for further analysis. For example, it would be interesting to compare subscription use between males and females, or to analyze the top 10 stations where most trips start and/or end.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential for data analysis and visualization in understanding the bike-sharing industry. By gaining a deeper understanding of the usage patterns and demographics of bike-sharing programs, cities can make data-driven decisions to improve the program and encourage more people to choose biking as a mode of transportation.
